## Downloading the project

If you would like to install this project on your computer, you will first need to [clone the repo](https://github.com/EstelleMyddleware/bilemo) of this project using Git.

At the root of your project, you need to create a .env.local file (same level as .env) in which you need to configure the appropriate values for your blog to run. Specifically, you need to override the following variables :

```text
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/bilemo"
ADMIN_EMAIL=youremail@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChooseAStrongPersonalPasswordHere
ADMIN_USERNAME=youradminusername
 ```

## Requirements

  * PHP 8.1.4 or above
  * [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
  * Download the [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download).
  * Run this command will guide you in cases there are missing extensions or parameters you need to tweek on your machine

```bash
symfony check:requirements  
```

## Install dependencies

Before running the project, you need to run the following commands in order to install the appropriate dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

## Create a database

Now let's create our database. This will use the DATABASE_URL you've provided in .env.local file.

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
```

## Generating the database schema

```bash
 php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
 ```

## Load fixtures (initial dummy data)

```bash
 php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load --append
 ```

## Running the webserver

Now you should be ready to launch the dev webserver using

```bash
symfony serve -d
```

The ```symfony serve``` command will start a PHP webserver.
You can now go to your localhost URL : <http://127.0.0.1:8000> where the blog should be displayed.

>NB: alternatively, if you do not wish to use the Symfony webserver, you can always use WAMP / Laragon / MAMP or a similar webserver suite.
